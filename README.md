## About me
Hi, I’m Erick Bogarin, a web developer from Brazil who lives in Manaus. I’m extremely passionate about software development and I spend my days with my hands in many different areas of web development from back-end programming to front-end engineering, user experience and visual design.

I appreciate challenging and creative projects, as a programmer I’m in a constantly search for better practices and also experimenting new technologies. I love to work and colaborate with the community, in my spare time I like to write on my blog or teach my friends about something that I’ve learned.
